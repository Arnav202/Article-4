<p><h4>This is a simple amplitude modulation (AM) transmitter, It contains two transistors. It has two stages, Here is how it works- <br> </h4></p><p><h5>The first stage is a simple amplifier, it might have some distortions or may be very bad. So you can add another amplifier yourself. Talking about the second <br>stage is a Colpitts oscillator plus a modulator, I was looking for a modulator and tested some circuits which failed to modulate the carrier wave. The transistor <br>used in the Colpitts oscillator is always in an ON state, so connecting a potentiometer and lowering the base current opens or makes the transistor to conduct <br>less which lowers the current at the collector which reduces the amplitude of the LC circuit. Now providing some audio or whatever signal at the base makes <br>the transistor 
conductive at the positive region and less conductive at the negative region of the signal, "It is an NPN transistor ". Since a capacitor is connected <br>at the emitter of the transistor which somehow manages to make the transistor oscillate, So the carrier signal also modulates with the input signal. The frequency <br>depends on the inductor and the capacitor in the circuit, Which you can calculate by this equation-. </h5></p>
