<p><h4>This is a simple amplitude modulation (AM) transmitter, It contains one transistor. It has one stage, Here is how it works- <br> </h4></p><p><h5>A Colpitts oscillator plus a modulator, I was looking for a modulator and tested some circuits which failed to modulate the carrier wave, I also have another circuit called "Gilbert Cell" which I will talk about later. The transistor in the Colpitts topology <br>oscillator is always in an ON state, so connecting a potentiometer and lowering the base current opens or makes the transistor less conductive lowering the current at the collector which reduces the amplitude of the LC circuit. Now provide some audio or whatever signal with some biasing voltage at the base. You might have heard of the "Emitter Follower Circuit", a transistor that is connected through an inductor at the collector and a 1kOhms resistor at the emitter(fig???) it acts as an Emitter follower which should be conductive at the positive region and less conductive at the negative region of the signal, "It is an NPN transistor ".Since a capacitor is connected at the emitter of the transistor which somehow manages to oscillate, So the carrier signal also modulates with the input signal. The frequency depends on the inductor and the capacitor in the circuit, Which you can calculate by this equation-. </h5></p>
